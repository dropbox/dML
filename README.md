# dML - Machine Learning Models

Machine learning inference engines optimized for Apple Silicon via MLX.

## Thesis

On-device AI should be fast, private, and free from cloud dependencies. These models run locally on Apple Silicon, enabling real-time speech recognition, text-to-speech, and translation without network latency or data leaving your machine.
