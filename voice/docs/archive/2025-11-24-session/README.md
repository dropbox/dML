## What's Here

These files were created during the intensive Phase 1 development session and contain historical information about:

- Intermediate status reports
- Alternative architecture explorations (C++, pure Rust)
- Session summaries and progress reports
- Experimental design documents
- Quick reference guides

2. **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Performance details
3. **STATUS_UPDATE_2025_11_24.md** - Latest configuration
4. **docs/** directory - Detailed technical documentation
