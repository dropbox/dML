\* TLC Configuration for AGXFix Model - LIVENESS CHECKING
\* Run with: java -jar tla2tools.jar -config AGXFix_liveness.cfg AGXFix.tla
\*
\* This configuration checks liveness properties (eventual progress)
\* in addition to safety invariants.
\*
\* Uses FairSpecV27 which includes weak fairness constraints to ensure
\* all enabled actions eventually execute.

\* Constants - keep small for tractable state space
CONSTANTS
    NumThreads = 2
    NumCommandBuffers = 2
    NumEncoders = 2

\* Use the fair specification which includes weak fairness constraints
SPECIFICATION FairSpecV27

\* Safety properties (invariants)
INVARIANT TypeOK
INVARIANT NoCrashes
INVARIANT NoValidationCrash
INVARIANT V27TrackingConsistent
INVARIANT MutexSafe

\* Liveness properties (temporal)
PROPERTY Liveness

\* Disable deadlock detection - terminal states are valid
CHECK_DEADLOCK FALSE
