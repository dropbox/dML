\* Apalache Configuration for MPSStreamPool
\* Symbolic bounded checking of safety invariants (no fairness)
\*
\* Note: Use smaller bounds for Apalache - Z3 struggles with larger
\* state spaces. TLC provides comprehensive enumeration at larger bounds.

\* Constants (small, solver-friendly bounds)
CONSTANT
    NumStreams = 2
    NumThreads = 2
    MaxOperations = 5

\* Spec is safety-only (no WF/SF fairness operators)
SPECIFICATION SpecNoFairness

\* State invariants (verified symbolically)
\* Note: Only use SafetyInvariant - MutualExclusion/PoolIntegrity use
\* quantifiers that make Z3 report UNKNOWN
INVARIANT SafetyInvariant
INVARIANT DeadlockFree
