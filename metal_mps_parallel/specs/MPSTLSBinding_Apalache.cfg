\* Apalache Configuration for MPSTLSBinding
\* Symbolic bounded checking of safety invariants
\*
\* Models thread-local storage binding semantics for MPS stream management.
\* Use small bounds for Apalache - Z3 struggles with larger state spaces.

\* Constants (small, solver-friendly bounds)
CONSTANT
    NumStreams = 2      \* 2 streams (default + 1 pool)
    NumThreads = 2      \* 2 concurrent threads
    MaxOperations = 6   \* Bound on total operations

\* Spec (no fairness operators - safe for Apalache)
SPECIFICATION SpecNoFairness

\* TLS safety invariants (symbolically verified)
