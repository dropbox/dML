\* Apalache Configuration for MPSFullSystem
\* Symbolic bounded checking of safety invariants
\*
\* This is a composed model integrating StreamPool, Allocator, and Event.
\* Use small bounds for Apalache - Z3 struggles with larger state spaces.
\* TLC (8M states) provides comprehensive enumeration at larger bounds.

\* Constants (small, solver-friendly bounds)
CONSTANT
    NumStreams = 2      \* 1 default + 1 worker
    NumThreads = 2      \* 2 concurrent threads
    NumBuffers = 2      \* 2 buffers in allocator
    NumEvents = 2       \* 2 events in pool
    MaxOperations = 6   \* Bound on total operations

\* Spec (no fairness operators - safe for Apalache)
