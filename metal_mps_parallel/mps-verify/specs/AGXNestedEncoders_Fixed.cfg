\* TLC Configuration for AGXNestedEncoders - FIXED WITH RECURSIVE MUTEX
\* Expected result: PASSES (no deadlock with recursive mutex)

SPECIFICATION Spec

CONSTANTS
    NumThreads = 2
    LockIsRecursive = TRUE  \* FIXED: Use recursive mutex

INVARIANTS
    TypeOK
    MutexOwnerDepthConsistent
    NoSelfDeadlock  \* EXPECTED TO PASS with recursive mutex

\* Contrast with AGXNestedEncoders.cfg which uses LockIsRecursive=FALSE
\* and demonstrates self-deadlock
