## Key Artifacts Verified

| Artifact | Path | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Deploy script | agx_patch/deploy_patch.sh | Present |
| Revert script | agx_patch/revert_patch.sh | Present |
| Patched binary | agx_patch/AGXMetalG16X_universal_patched | Present (20MB) |
| Verification test | tests/verify_patch.py | Present |

## Remaining Work

Binary patch deployment requires user action:
1. User disables SIP (csrutil disable in recovery mode)
2. Run agx_patch/deploy_patch.sh
3. Reboot and run tests/verify_patch.py

## Conclusion

Userspace fix (v2.7 dylib + Semaphore(2)) remains stable at 0% crash rate.
All automated work complete. Binary patch deployment awaits user SIP action.
