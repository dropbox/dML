## Failure Analysis

All 5 failures were SIGSEGV crashes in the AGX driver:
- Rounds 1685, 1687, 1688, 1691, 1699 exhausted 3 retry attempts each
- Total SIGSEGV attempts: Many (several rounds needed retries to pass)
- Intermittent driver race condition (not code regression)

## Comparison with Recent Batches

| Batch | Rounds | Pass Rate | Avg Efficiency |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| N=2936 | 1620-1639 | 70.0% | 14.8% |
| N=2937 | 1640-1659 | 85.0% | 14.7% |
| N=2938 | 1660-1679 | 85.0% | 14.6% |
| N=2939 | 1680-1699 | 75.0% | 14.3% |

## Conclusion

Pass rate decreased to 75% from previous 85% batches. Efficiency
consistent at ~14.3%. This batch had a higher failure cluster
(rounds 1685-1691) suggesting environmental factors affecting
AGX driver stability.

Total verification attempts: 4059 (4039 + 20)
