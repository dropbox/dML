**Pass Rate**: 9/10 (90%)
**Failure**: Round 1612 - intermittent Apple MPS driver SIGSEGV

## Metrics Update

- **Previous consecutive streak**: 1433 rounds
- **New consecutive streak**: 7 rounds (1613-1619)
- **Total verification attempts**: 3979 (3969 + 10)
- **Complete "trying hard" cycles**: 199 (196 + 3)

## Analysis

Round 1612 failure is consistent with documented behavior:
> "Some multi-threaded MPS workloads remain intermittent in Apple's stack"
- from scripts/run_mps_test.sh

This is an Apple-side driver issue, not a regression in our code. The native PyTorch 2.9.1 MPS threading support (no dylib injection) still experiences occasional SIGSEGV in Apple's Metal/MPS stack.

## Efficiency Measurements

| Round | 8-thread Efficiency |
|-------|---------------------|
| 1610 | 14.3% |
| 1611 | 13.8% |
| 1613 | 13.9% |
| 1614 | 14.1% |
| 1615 | 14.6% |
| 1616 | 15.5% |
| 1617 | 14.7% |
| 1618 | 14.9% |
| 1619 | 15.1% |

Average efficiency: 14.5% (within documented ~13% ceiling range)

## Status

- **SIP**: Enabled (deployment blocked)
- **PyTorch**: 2.9.1 native MPS threading
- **Test mode**: No dylib injection
