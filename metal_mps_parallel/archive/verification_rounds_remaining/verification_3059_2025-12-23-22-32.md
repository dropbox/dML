# Verification Report - Worker #3059

**Date**: 2025-12-23 22:32 PST  
**Dylib**: v2.5 + Semaphore(2) throttling

## Test Results

| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| metal_diagnostics | PASS | MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice: Apple M4 Max |
| test_semaphore_recommended | PASS | Lock: 856 ops/s, Sem(2): 1012 ops/s, 18% speedup |
| complete_story_test_suite | PASS | All 4 chapters pass |
| soak_test_quick (60s) | PASS | 489,226 ops, 8152.7 ops/s, 0 errors |

## Crash Status

- Crashes before: 259
- Crashes after: 259
- New crashes: 0

## Summary

System remains stable. Semaphore(2) throttling achieves 0-crash operation with
consistent ~18% throughput improvement over full serialization.

Binary patch deployment (for full parallelism) requires user action.
