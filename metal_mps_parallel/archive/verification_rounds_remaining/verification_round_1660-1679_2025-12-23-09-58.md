| 1679 | FAIL | SIGSEGV |

## Failure Analysis

All 3 failures were SIGSEGV crashes in the AGX driver:
- `AGX::ComputeContext::prepareForEnqueue()` offset 0x98
- Intermittent driver race condition (not code regression)
- Consistent with previous batches

## Comparison with Recent Batches

| Batch | Rounds | Pass Rate | Avg Efficiency |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| N=2936 | 1620-1639 | 70.0% | 14.8% |
| N=2937 | 1640-1659 | 85.0% | 14.7% |
| N=2938 | 1660-1679 | 85.0% | 14.6% |

## Conclusion

Pass rate remains stable at 85%, matching the previous batch. Efficiency
consistent at ~14.6%. Failures continue to be intermittent AGX driver
crashes, not regressions in our fix.
