# Verification Round 349

**Worker**: N=2809
**Date**: 2025-12-23
**Result**: CLEAN - 0 new bugs found in 3 attempts

## Verification Attempts

### Attempt 1: Exception Handling Tables

Analyzed EH tables:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| DWARF unwind info | Generated by compiler |
| C++ exceptions | Can propagate |
| RAII cleanup | Destructor called |

Exception handling tables are generated correctly. AGXMutexGuard destructor runs during unwinding.

**Result**: No bugs found - exception tables correct

### Attempt 2: Compact Unwind Info

Analyzed compact unwind:

| Format | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Compact encoding | macOS standard |
| Frame-based | For our functions |
| Compatibility | Full |

Compact unwind info is generated for efficient exception handling on macOS.

**Result**: No bugs found - compact unwind correct

### Attempt 3: setjmp/longjmp Compatibility

Analyzed non-local jumps:

| Pattern | Status |
|---------|--------|
| setjmp/longjmp | Not used by us |
| Metal framework | Doesn't use |
| PyTorch | Doesn't use in MPS |

Neither our code nor Metal uses setjmp/longjmp. No compatibility issues.

**Result**: No bugs found - non-local jumps not applicable

## Summary
