## Summary

- Pass rate: **19/20 (95.0%)**
- Retry behavior: **5/20** runs needed retry; **1** exhausted (round 2024)
- 8-thread efficiency: ~14.3% (consistent with documented ceiling)

## Notes

- rc=133 indicates SIGSEGV (signal 11 = 128+11=139, but 133 is SIGSTOP which may indicate different signal handling)
- The AGX driver race condition remains timing-dependent
- v2.3 continues to show consistent 90-100% pass rate with retry
