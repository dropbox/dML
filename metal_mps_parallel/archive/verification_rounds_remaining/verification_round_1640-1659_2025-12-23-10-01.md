**Pass Rate**: 17/20 (85.0%)
- Previous batch (1620-1639): 70.0%
- Improvement: +15% pass rate

**Failures**: Rounds 1645, 1650, 1653 - intermittent Apple AGX driver SIGSEGV

## Crash Analysis

All failures crash in the same location:
```
AGX::ComputeContext<...>::prepareForEnqueue(bool) + 1268
  -> NULL pointer dereference at 0x0000000000000098
```

Called from `at::native::mps::MetalShaderLibrary::exec_binary_kernel()` - internal Apple AGX driver issue.
