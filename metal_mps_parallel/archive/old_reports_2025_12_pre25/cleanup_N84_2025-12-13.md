# Cleanup Verification Report - N=84

**Worker**: N=84 (N mod 7 = 0, CLEANUP iteration)
**Date**: 2025-12-13 15:44 PST

## Verification Summary

All cleanup tasks completed successfully.

### Test Results

```
ALL 8 TESTS PASS:
- Simple Parallel MPS:       PASS
- Extended Stress Test:      PASS
- Thread Boundary:           PASS
- Stream Assignment:         PASS
- Benchmark (nn.Linear):     PASS
- Real Models Parallel:      PASS
- Over-Subscription Detection: PASS
- Thread Churn (Freelist):   PASS
```

### Cleanup Actions

1. **Temporary TSan output files removed**:
   - `tests/tsan_cpp_output.txt`
   - `tests/tsan_cpp_output_8threads.txt`
   - `tests/tsan_cpp_output_16threads.txt`

2. **Local pycache cleaned**:
   - `tests/__pycache__/` removed

3. **Patch verification**:
   - `021-cumulative-phase17-plus.patch` matches `cumulative-v2.9.1-to-mps-stream-pool.patch`
   - Both are 1248 lines (14 files, 620 insertions, 97 deletions)

4. **Documentation verified**:
   - `patches/README.md` accurately describes patch 021 as current
   - All phase statuses in `MPS_PARALLEL_INFERENCE_PLAN.md` are accurate
