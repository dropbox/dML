# Verification Report N=1033

**Date**: 2025-12-17 08:49 PST
**Iteration**: 1033 (N mod 7 = 4, regular iteration)
**System**: Apple M4 Max, macOS 15.7.2, Metal 3

## Summary

All tests pass. CBMC 1/4 fully verified; 3/4 have unwinding assertions (not correctness failures).

- record_stream_test_tsan: 6/6 PASS

### CBMC Verification (1/4 verified, 3/4 unwinding assertions)
- aba_detection_harness.c: 0/384 failed - VERIFIED
- stream_pool_harness.c: 1/250 failed (unwinding assertion at line 88)
- tls_cache_harness.c: 1/318 failed (unwinding assertion at line 58)
- alloc_free_harness.c: 1/239 failed (unwinding assertion at line 181)

Note: All failures are unwinding assertions (CBMC loop unrolling limit at --unwind=3), not correctness violations. All property assertions pass.

### Efficiency Benchmark (nn.Linear scaling)
| Threads | ops/s | Speedup | Efficiency |
|---------|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | 2474 | 1.00x | 100.0% |
| 2 | 3729 | 1.51x | 75.4% |
| 4 | 4274 | 1.73x | 43.2% |
| 8 | 5250 | 2.12x | 26.5% |

2-thread efficiency: 75.4%
