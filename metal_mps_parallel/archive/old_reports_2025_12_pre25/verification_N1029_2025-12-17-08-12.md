# Verification Report - N=1029 (CLEANUP)
Date: Wed Dec 17 08:25 PST 2025
Device: Apple M4 Max (Metal 3, 40 cores)
macOS: 15.7.2

## Patch Integrity
- Base: v2.9.1
- Fork HEAD: 561cb76b
- Patch: patches/cumulative-v2.9.1-to-mps-stream-pool.patch
- MD5: 1b29a15407eb4019b4fdb9bf8b5a26d9
- Files: 51

## Test Results
- Metal diagnostics: VISIBLE (Apple M4 Max, MTLCopyAllDevices count: 1)
- Python tests: 24/24 PASS
- TSan (2 threads, 50 iter): 0 errors, 20ms
- record_stream_test_tsan: 6/6 PASS

## CBMC Verification
Harnesses located at `mps-verify/verification/cbmc/harnesses/`

| Harness | Assertions | Result |
|---------|------------|--------|
| aba_detection_harness.c | 0/384 failed | SUCCESS |
| stream_pool_harness.c | 0/249 failed | SUCCESS |
| tls_cache_harness.c | 0/318 failed | SUCCESS |
| alloc_free_harness.c | - | TIMEOUT (>2min, unwind=5-10) |

**Note**: 3/4 CBMC harnesses verified. alloc_free_harness times out in this session. Total verified assertions: 951 (384+249+318).

## Performance
- Efficiency test (nn.Linear, 2048x2048, batch=64): 73.3%
  - 1 thread: 482 ops/s
  - 2 threads: 707 ops/s
  - Speedup: 1.47x

## Cleanup Activities (N mod 7 = 0)
1. Verified CBMC harnesses exist at `mps-verify/verification/cbmc/harnesses/` (4 files)
2. 3/4 harnesses pass quickly; alloc_free times out (may need longer runtime or different unwind)
3. Full Python test suite: 24/24 PASS
4. mps-verify/ directory exists locally but not tracked in main repo git

## Summary
CLEANUP iteration verified all Python and TSan tests passing. 3/4 CBMC harnesses verified (951 assertions). Patch remains stable at 73.3% efficiency.
