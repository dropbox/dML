## Cleanup Audit

### Patches Directory
- **Status**: Clean
- **Current Patch**: 021-cumulative-phase17-plus.patch (only one needed)
- **Historical Patches**: 001-020 retained for development history documentation
- patches/README.md clearly marks superseded patches

### Reports Directory
- **Status**: Clean
- 10 verification reports (N29-N62) serve as audit trail
- No broken references found
- Important reports (N48, N36) correctly referenced

### Tests Directory
- **Status**: Clean
- 8 tests in main suite (run_all_tests.sh)
- Additional files are investigation tests from earlier phases:
  - test_parallel_mps.py - original version (superseded by test_parallel_mps_simple.py)
  - test_nnlinear_threads.py, test_thread_limit_investigation.py - investigation
  - test_multiprocess_vs_multithread.py, test_cross_stream_tensor.py - investigation
  - test_tsan_basic.py, tsan_mps_test.mm - TSan validation
  - multiprocess_inference_pool.py - utility
- These are referenced in historical reports; not harmful to retain

### Root Directory
- **Status**: Clean
- .gitignore correctly excludes tsan output files and build artifacts
- tsan_suppressions.txt properly located for TSAN_OPTIONS references

## Conclusion

Project is well-organized. No cleanup actions required. Last cleanup was N=56 which removed duplicate patch 020.

## Project Status

- All phases complete through Phase 17+
- Phase 8 (upstream PR) awaits human action
- Project stable and feature-complete

## Next AI

Continue routine verification or await manager instructions.
