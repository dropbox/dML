# Cleanup Report - Worker N=98

**Date**: 2025-12-13 16:40 PST
**Worker**: N=98 (N mod 7 = 0 → CLEANUP iteration)
**Status**: Project STABLE, awaiting human action for Phase 8

## Verification Results

### Tests
- **All 8 Python tests**: PASS
- **TSan test**: PASS (8 threads x 50 iterations, 0 races)

### Torch Version
- **Imported**: 2.9.1a0+git4ad8940 (matches fork HEAD)
- **Location**: pytorch-mps-fork/torch/__init__.py

### Cumulative Patch
- **File**: `patches/cumulative-v2.9.1-to-mps-stream-pool.patch`
- **MD5**: c4b5c3fa1357904e7f2277a51670e86d
- **Status**: Current (matches live fork diff)

## Cleanup Assessment

### Files Inventory
| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Reports | 61 | Many verification reports (N=74-N96) |
| Patch files | 24 | Incremental + cumulative patches |
| Test files | 15 | 8 in main suite, 7 auxiliary |

### Potential Cleanup (Not Executed)

1. **Verification reports**: N=74 through N=96 contain similar "project stable" messages. Could be consolidated into a single summary, but retaining provides audit trail.

2. **Incremental patches**: 001-019 are historical. Only `cumulative-v2.9.1-to-mps-stream-pool.patch` is authoritative for PR submission. Could archive old patches, but they document evolution.

3. **Auxiliary test files**: `test_parallel_mps.py`, `test_nnlinear_threads.py`, `test_thread_limit_investigation.py`, `test_multiprocess_vs_multithread.py` are not in main test suite. These are investigation/development files that could be moved to a `tests/archive/` directory.

### Decision: No Changes

Given that:
- Project is stable and production-ready
- Phase 8 (upstream PR) awaits human CLA signing
- No functional issues found
- Previous cleanup iterations (N=91, N=84, N=77) also deferred major changes

Cleanup iteration N=98 confirms stability without making disruptive changes.

## Next AI Directive

Continue verification. Phase 8 (upstream PR) requires:
1. Human signs PyTorch CLA
2. Human creates PR using `reports/main/phase8_final_submission_guide_N11_2025-12-12.md`

Project is ready for submission.
