## Complete Story Test Suite Details

- thread_safety: PASS (8 threads, no crashes)
- efficiency_ceiling: PASS (19.4% at 8 threads)
- batching_advantage: PASS
- correctness: PASS (max diff 0.000001 < 0.001)

## Crash Status

- Crashes before: 259
- Crashes after: 259
- New crashes: 0

## Configuration

- AGX Fix: v2.5 dylib + Semaphore(2) throttling
- MPS_FORCE_GRAPH_PATH: 1

## Conclusion

System remains stable. Semaphore(2) throttling provides 0% crash rate with
10-19% throughput improvement over full serialization.

Binary patch deployment (for full parallelism) requires user action.
