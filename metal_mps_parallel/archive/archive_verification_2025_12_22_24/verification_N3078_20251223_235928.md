## Crash Status

- Crashes before tests: 259
- Crashes after tests: 259
- New crashes: 0

## Configuration

- AGX Fix: v2.5 dylib

- MPS_FORCE_GRAPH_PATH: 1

## Conclusion

Semaphore(2) throttling continues to provide 0% crash rate with consistent throughput improvement over full serialization. Binary patch deployment awaits user action (requires SIP disabled).
